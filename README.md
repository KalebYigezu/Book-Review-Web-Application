# Book-Review-Web-Application
In this project, I built a book review web application. Users are able to register for my web application and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. I also used a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review web application, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via your websiteâ€™s API.
